This project involved implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm to train an intelligent agent (a pirate) to navigate a maze and find treasure. The provided code included classes for the maze environment (TreasureMaze) and experience replay (GameExperience), helper functions for visualization, and a skeleton structure for the Q-learning algorithm. My main contribution was completing the Q-training algorithm implementation in the qtrain function. This involved implementing the core training loop, managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, updating the neural network model based on experiences, and tracking training progress.
The work exemplifies what computer scientists do: solving complex problems by developing algorithms and systems that can process information, make decisions, and learn from experience. This project demonstrates how computer scientists create intelligent agents capable of navigating complex environments and making optimal decisions - skills applicable to various fields like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems. It matters because these technologies can improve efficiency, safety, and decision-making in numerous real-world applications.
Approaching this problem as a computer scientist involved breaking it down into manageable components (environment, agent, learning algorithm), implementing and iteratively refining the solution, and analyzing performance through metrics like win rate and loss. This systematic approach of problem decomposition, implementation, and data-driven improvement is fundamental to tackling complex computational problems across various domains in computer science.
Ethical responsibilities in this context include ensuring the system behaves safely and predictably, considering potential misuse or unintended consequences in real-world applications, being transparent about the system's capabilities and limitations, and striving for fairness and avoiding bias in training data and algorithms. As AI systems increasingly impact decision-making processes in various fields, it's crucial to consider these ethical implications throughout the development process to ensure responsible and beneficial AI deployment.
